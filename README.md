# VaccinationsDuringCovid
This is a project done in SQL Server Management Studio. In this project we are dealing with a dataset that contains various information about the vaccinations given during Covid, the immortality rate across the globe during Covid, etc...
----

Initially, we load the data from the Database we had created. Then we look at the total number of cases, deaths and contractions of Covid in India.

Then, we look at the countries with the highest infection and death rate of Covid. Which we then expand to look at continents with the highest death rate, and then to the death rate across the world.

After that we look at the death rate and Covid contraction across the world per day.

Then we join two tables to find the total number of people vaccinated across the world per day using CTE and Temp Table.

Finally, we create a view to look at the Highest Covid Probability across the globe.

Thank you!
